Title: Basic Infrastructure on Gcloud
Date: 2019-06-10

- Made repo on github
- Created jsonnet to make tf config for a k8s cluster on gcloud
- Created projects, service accounts etc. for gcloud in order for tf to run
    - Not sure I really understand the intended relationships between
      organisations, projects, etc. - need to read up on this.
- Used the terraform config to make a (single, tiny node) k8s cluster on gke.

Title: Hello World Deployed
Date: 2019-06-11
- Sorted out Pelican config for generating static web content.
- Nginx docker image built to server static content.
- Basic k8s infrastructure for load balancer + deployment for nginx.
- Static content served correctly.
- In fiddling about with permissions tf is now not quite working properly - it
  deploys resources OK, but then errors after the event with: 

~~~
Error: Error reading instance group manager returned as an instance group
URL: "googleapi: Error 403: Required 'compute.instanceGroupManagers.get'
permission for
'projects/xamaral/zones/europe-west2-a/instanceGroupManagers/gke-xamaral-xamaral-k8s-node-pool-e4f88150-grp',
forbidden"'
~~~
I don't really know what's going on here. I need to spend more time on
the whole service accounts / roles / permissions stuff.

# Up next
- Dns resolution for the load balancer.
- Certificate handling.
- Pelican configuration.
- Get this journal served as part of the static site.

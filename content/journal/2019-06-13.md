Title: Domain Names and Certificates
Date: 2019-06-13

- Config for nginx ingress controller and cert manager.
    - ... but I've manually configured the A record once the ingress
      controller's load balancer gets a public ip. This needs to be
      automatically done so that everything works if the ip address changes for
      some reason.
- Basic customisation of Pelican.
- Moved journal to a Pelican blog category.

# Up Next
- Sort out terraform / gcloud permissions so that (most) infrastructure can be
  automatically provisioned from scratch.
- Fix layout of Pelican generated content - the publishing info sidebar doesn't
  always render properly.

Title: Gcloud and Pelican Layout
Date: 2019-06-16

- Switched the Pelican theme for cosmetic improvements. I've lost the "tweet"
  button along the way, but the new theme apparently supports this so I'll sort
  this out later.
  
- Read up on gcloud permissions and roles and sorted out the permissions for
  the service account used by terraform. There's scope for pushing more of the
  infrastructure into terraform: the substantive project holding the k8s
  cluster etc. could be defined in the tf config.
  
### Up Next

I want to add comments for the blog. That means user accounts and hence
auth'n'auth. I could use auth0 (again) for this, but I'm keen on really getting
a good grip on all the nitty gritty, so I plan to implement an oidc/oauth2
server. This will likely take at least a couple of weeks. So the first job is
simply a minimal web api with a persistent representation of at least users
(resource owners), clients and tokens.

Title: Skeleton for Authenication and Authorization server
Date: 2019-06-18

- Created "hello world" web api, to form the basis of an authentication server.

- Wrote a blog post describing the above: https://xamaral.com/creating-a-web-api-with-aiohttp-and-mongo.html

  
### Up Next

- Get the "tweet this" button back in the pelican theme.
- Add a tag cloud or similar in a side base.
- Look into adsense or similar.
- It's going to be a while before I have my own production ready authentication
  framework, so investigate using auth0 or similar for now.

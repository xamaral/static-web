Title: Cosmetic Pelican fixes.
Date: 2019-06-19

- Used the pelican theme settings to add a tweet button (via Addthis
  integration) and a tags sidebar to articles.

- Investigated adsense via themes. Of the ones packaged up via
  https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes, only one - Flex - appears to have out of
  the box Adsense support.
  
- Investigated Auth0. The free plan looks fine for current needs.
  
### Up Next

- Fork pelican-bootstrap. 
  - Add Addsense support.
  - Options for positions the Addthis banner.
  
- Look into disqus type libraries/frameworks for diy comments.

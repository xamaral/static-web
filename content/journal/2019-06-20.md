Title: Pelican tweaks.
Date: 2019-06-20

- Forked the pelican-themes repo and allowed for some customisation of where
  the addthis button(s) go. https://github.com/PaulRudin/pelican-themes/tree/adthis-positioning/pelican-bootstrap3
  
- Made a start on Adsense for that same theme. I'm awaiting google's activation
  of the Adsense account before I can test in earnest.
  
- Spent some time looking at options around
  auth'n'auth. [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) looks interesting.

### Up Next

- Sort out adsense once I have an account.
- Experiment with using nginx/keycloak as a SSO solution.

Title: Comments system.
Date: 2019-07-03

- Added config to make an [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso) docker image along
  with config to deploy this and add comments to articles. This is just
  experimental for now.

- There are a few things would need improving:
    - Authentication for comments poster.
    - Better persistence. Isso just uses sqllite, so I'm simply provisioning a
      stateful set with a single replica - which is fine, but doesn't
      scale.
    
- I'm not sure what can be done to address these issues with Isso. But I've
  spotted a few other open source comments engines, some of which might be more
  suitable. For example:
      - [Commento](https://github.com/adtac/commento)
      - [Mouthful](https://github.com/vkuznecovas/mouthful)
      - [Schnack](https://github.com/schn4ck/schnack)
      - [Talkyard](https://github.com/debiki/talkyard)
  



### Up Next

- Spend some time evaluating comments systems.
- With a couple of different docker images, the number of manual steps for
  deploying everything increases. Either better Makefiles, or possibly look at
  using Bazel.
